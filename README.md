# Bookmarkie
A web application build on the Sinatra framework that stores and recalls website URLs. Users are able to register with a unique email address and once signed-in, can save bookmarks with tags which can be shown or searched. A demo of the application can be found on Heroku at https://bookmarkie-manager.herokuapp.com/
